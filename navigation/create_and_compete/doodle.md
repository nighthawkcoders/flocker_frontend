The page is a place where people can explore themselves creatively and compete to see who has the best doodle. This allows for players to collaborate over their artistic abilities. Our room includes a chat room where players can converse about their creations, a doodle compete area, a place where people can post their art, and winners get crowned every week. This will help add to our classes page by making a fun artistic environment where everyone can collaborate. </p>
