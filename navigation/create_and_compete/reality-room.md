  <p>The idea behind reality room is that the discussion of real and fake topics will be brought up.</p>

  <p>Room includes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mini game - Am I talking to a human or an AI chatbot?</li>
    <li>Posts that people can make about a certain topic, such as an AI generated image, and ask people if its AI generated or real, who will then comment on their choice.</li>
    <li>In order to fit in with the "rate and relate" theme, people could rate how believable/unbelievable the post topic was and how if it fooled them or not. Then they could relate with others who also thought of a similar opinion</li>
  </ul>
